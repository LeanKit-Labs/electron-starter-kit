# electron-starter-kit
A simple, LeanKit-themed project to get started with Electron.js. 

This project is based on [electron-prebuilt-compile](https://github.com/paulcbetts/electron-prebuilt-compile), which is a variation of Electron that natively supports ES6 + React + LESS, so you can spend more time focusing on building a great desktop application, and less time fighting with things like Babel, Webpack, etc.

## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/LeanKit-Labs/electron-starter-kit.git
npm install
npm start
```
